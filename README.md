RShell
======

purpose
-------
'RShell' is a basic command shell that displays a command prompt and reads in user-entered commands in one line.
This program is currently a work in progress.

bugs
----
* In its current standing, RShell only works with single commands and cannot accept the connecters:
`(;, &&, and ||)`.
* There is currently no exit command in effect.
* RShell can only be executed one time. Once a command is successful, the program will exit.
